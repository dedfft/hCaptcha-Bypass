# hCaptcha-Solver
A quick hCaptcha solver, free of trojans. **I'm pretty sure h0nde originially made this, all credits to the creators**

```python3
import solvermodule

token = solvermodule.bypass(sitekey, host)
```

# Before Running
Make sure you have Python3 installed, httpx and requests. Please, also note you need to add a accessabillity cookie; scroll through the code or use CTRL+F in order to find the line where it defines said cookie.
You'll have to change the cookie every ~24h, as it expires every day.
